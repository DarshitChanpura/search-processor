# Search Relevance

## Overview
In a search engine, the relevance is the measure of the relationship accuracy between the search query and the search result. Higher the relevance is, the higher is the quality of search result and the users are able to get more relevant content. This project aims to add plugins to OpenSearch to help users make their query results more accurate, contextual and relevant.
